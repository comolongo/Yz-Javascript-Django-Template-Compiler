To setup the demo:

1. Make sure the yz_js_django_tpl package is in your project path, it should suffice to put it in your base project folder i.e. DJANGO_PROJECT_FOLDER/yz_js_django_tpl

2. Move the yz_djs_demo_app folder to the project path as well, i.e. DJANGO_PROJECT_FOLDER/yz_djs_demo_app

4. Open up yz_djs_demo_app/generate_js_tpl.py and make sure DJANGO_DIRECTORY_PATH points to the base of your django project directory.

5. From the commandline navigate to the demo folder and type:
python generate_js_tpl.py
That should autogenerate the django templates from yz_djs_demo_templates into javascript functions

6. In your project DJANGO_PROJECT_FOLDER/settings.py file, add 'yz_djs_demo_app' into the list of installed apps

7. In your project DJANGO_PROJECT_FOLDER/url.py file at the project into the url path by adding     (r'^yz_djs_demo/', include('yz_djs_demo_app.urls')) into the url patterns list

This should be enough to get everything up and running. If you goto your /yz_djs_demo of your project domain, you will be able to see it, otherwise you can always checkout
